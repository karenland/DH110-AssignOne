# Making Reading and the Joy of Reading Accessible. 

<b>Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation</b>
<br>Karen Landeros -- DH-110 -- Spring 2021

Project description:
After the initial wave of lockdowns and closures, many things become accessible from home, especially reading. Ebooks have been on the rise for years now but even now, the ebook industry experienced a boom during lockdowns. My project will touch on two websites: Goodreads and WEBTOON. Goodreads is a popular website for the enthusiastic readers as it gives users books recommendations, and allows them to join communities as well as give them updates about their bookish friends. WEBTOON is a popular WEBTOON app that stems from the Korean company, Naver. Both websites have something in common: they assume readers have a strong idea of the media pieces the sites themselves focus on. Both sites are not mindful of those who need accessibility settings/control on their sites. 

# Website 1: [Goodreads]
(https://www.goodreads.com/)(https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodreads-book-reviews/id355833469) 



<b>Why I chose this website:</b>

Goodreads is not an attractive website/application. For the longest time, it was simply cluttered with simple text and barely any visuals. Now there is a bit more balance but still, it is not an attractive app especially considering its age and backing (est. in 2007 and bought by Amazon 2013). 

<b>Overall evaluation:</b>

In my opinion, the app feels like it’s missing a little bit of something in each area of its IOS mobile application. It’s not a very fun app to be on due to its outdated UI. It also has typical system errors like slow loading pages and it even freezes a lot.
